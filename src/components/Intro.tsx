          After studying media at the University of Bayreuth, I worked for an
          agency where I had the opportunity to build a variety of websites
          involving e-commerce, content management and responsive design. In
          2021, I started creating my own projects as well as freelancing for
          clients. Among them are various artists and a cryptocurrency exchange.
